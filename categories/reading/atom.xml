    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I read a book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920072768.do">Designing Distributed Systems</a>, which is written by <a href="https://twitter.com/brendandburns">Brendan Burns</a>, and published by O’Reilly earlier this year. This book introduces the patterns and components used in the development of distributed systems.</p>

<p>Before I started to read this book, I had three questions in my mind, and try to find the answers from the book. Those three questions are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What’s the most important difference between designing distributed systems and single machine systems?</li>
  <li>Why container technology, such as docker, kubernates, is so popular? How could it be helpful?</li>
  <li>What are the common patterns used in distributed systems design, and when shall I use them?</li>
</ol>

<p>This book does give me the answers, at least partial ones. I put my reading notes into a Google Slides, and  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1srX9hRS9tbtrEx7T1abxbHiD1gASkvllf1_W2SjuadA/edit?usp=sharing">you can find it here to read the details</a>. A PDF version in light background color is <a href="https://github.com/euccas/euccas.github.io/blob/source/data/read-2018-design_distributed_systems_lightver.pdf">available here</a>.</p>

<p>The short answers to my questions are as in the following:</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-most-important-difference-between-designing-distributed-systems-and-single-machine-systems">What’s the most important difference between designing distributed systems and single machine systems?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Designing distributed systems can be significantly more complicated to design, build, and debug correctly.</li>
  <li>Designing distributed systems need much more efforts in designing for scalability and reliability.</li>
  <li>In a distributed system, tasks/data are spreaded to multiple workers. It requires techniques like containers and load balancing to utilize parallelisation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-container-technology-docker-kubernetes-is-so-popular-how-could-they-be-helpful">Why container technology (docker, kubernetes) is so popular? How could they be helpful?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Containers are not only useful for applications which have components running on multiple machines, but also for single machine applications.</li>
  <li>The goal of containerization is to <strong>establish boundaries</strong> around specific resources, team ownership, separation of concerns.</li>
  <li>The benefits include <strong>resource isolation</strong>, <strong>scaling teams</strong>, <strong>reuse components and modules</strong>, <strong>break big problems</strong> into smaller ones (Small, focused applications are easier to understand, be tested, updated and deployed)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-the-common-patterns-used-in-distributed-systems-design-and-when-shall-i-use-them">What are the common patterns used in distributed systems design, and when shall I use them?</h2>

<p>The book describes three types of patterns.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Single node</strong> patterns: sidecar, ambassadors, adapters</li>
  <li><strong>Serving</strong> patterns: sharded services, scatter/gather, FaaS, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Batch computational</strong> patterns: Work queue, Event-driven batch processing, coordinated batch processsing, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more detailed description of each design pattern in my reading notes.</p>
