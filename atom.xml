    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20180213/performance-profiling-tools-on-windows</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, I wrote a blog post about <a href="http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170827/cpu-profiling-tools-on-linux.html">CPU Profiling and the tools on Linux</a>. Today I’m going to write about a few Performance profiling tools on Windows platform. Last week I was working on profiling and analyzing the build process of a project on Windows, and during the process I experimented with a few different tools.</p>

<h1 id="performance-monitor-perfmon">Performance Monitor (perfmon)</h1>

<p><strong>Performance Monitor</strong> is a small utility provided by Windows OS, you can start it by running command <code>perfmon</code>. With perfmon, you can monitor real-time system performance, and record performance to files for post analysis. This tool provides some extremely useful interfaces in its GUI.</p>

<h2 id="real-time-performance">Real-time Performance</h2>

<p>To view current performance activity, you just need click on the <strong>Performance Monitor</strong> button in the left panel:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2018/20180213-perfmon_0.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>By default, this view has only one performance counter: <code>% CPU Processor Time</code>. You can add more counters you need, such as Processor’s Idle Time, Cache Performance, Network Performance and a lot more.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2018/20180213-perfmon_1.png" width="600" /></p>

<h2 id="performance-recording">Performance Recording</h2>

<p>When analyzing an application’s performance, we often need record all the performance data and generate various reports to help analysis. We can do this in perfmon by adding <strong>User Defined Data Collector Sets</strong> (from Menu Action -&gt; New -&gt; Data Collector Sets).</p>

<p>Perfmon allows you to choose a template to start with, and specify the location where the performance data will be saved. The process is quite straightforward as provided in the GUI. There is only one thing that you need pay attention to: the <strong>Stop Condition</strong>. By default, a newly created Data Collector Sets has “stop condition” as <strong>“Overall duration: 1 minute”</strong>. With this condition set, the performance recording will stop in 1 minute after starting. If the process you are monitoring takes longer than 1 minute to finish, you definitely want to increase this “Overall duration” to some longer time.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2018/20180213-perfmon_2.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>With the added Data Collector Sets, you can start recording before running your application, and stop recording any time you want. The recorded data will be shown in the <strong>Reports</strong> session in the left panel. The report can also be viewed as graphs in the Performance Monitor.</p>

<p>The following is one example of displaying performance report in <strong>Stacked Area Graph</strong>. The other graph types you can choose are: <strong>Line</strong>, <strong>Histogram bar</strong>, <strong>Area</strong>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2018/20180213-perfmon_3.png" width="600" /></p>

<h1 id="windows-performance-recorder-wpr">Windows Performance Recorder (WPR)</h1>

<p><strong>Windows Performance Recorder (WPR)</strong> is a performance recording tool that is based on Event Tracing for Windows. It is available for Windows 8 or later. It records system events that you can then analyze by using Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). This tool is included in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK), and you can download it <a href="https://insider.windows.com/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="recording-with-wpr">Recording with WPR</h2>

<p>When WPR starts, it will guide you to choose a few configurations: <strong>profiles</strong>, <strong>scenario</strong>, <strong>details level</strong> and <strong>logging mode</strong>. You can follow the instructions <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/wpr-quick-start">here on Microsoft Docs</a> to decide how to choose for your need.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2018/20180213-wpr_0.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>Then you can start recording performance by clicking the <strong>“Start”</strong> button. The recording will end when you click the <strong>“Save”</strong> button or <strong>“Cancel”</strong> button. If “Save” is clicked, the performance data will be stored to files, and Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) will be automatically launched to show the performance reports.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-in-wpa">Reporting in WPA</h2>

<p>WPA provides detailed performance analysis data in its rich user interface. In the left <strong>“Graph Explorer”</strong>, you can choose to view performance graphs for <strong>System Activities</strong>, <strong>Computation</strong>, <strong>Storage</strong>, <strong>Memory</strong>, and <strong>Power</strong>. To see the graphs, just drag the graph to the <strong>“Analysis”</strong> tab on the right side.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2018/20180213-wpa_0.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>Comparing to Performance Monitor (perfmon), WPA reports give you more details and flexibility to explore the data.</p>

<p>This graph is a process lifetime graph generated by WPA.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2018/20180213-wpa_1.png" width="600" /></p>

<h2 id="load-symbols-in-wpa">Load symbols in WPA</h2>

<p>WPA supports <strong>loading symbols</strong> so you can see more details of each process or command. The paths of symbols can be added either from UI, or by setting environment variable <code>_NT_SYMBOL_PATH</code>. You can read <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh448137(v%3dwin.10)">this instruction</a> to understand how to load symbols or configure symbol paths in WPA.</p>

<h1 id="xperf">Xperf</h1>

<p><strong>Xperf</strong> is a command-line tool for performance recording on Windows. It is also included in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK). Starting from Windows 8, WPR becomes the recommended tool for performance recording, the support is still maintained for Xperf though.</p>

<p>Xperf works in a similarly way as WPR. It doesn’t have a GUI, but provides about ten command line options to process performance recording. The most commonly used ones probably are just <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code>.</p>

<p>You can simply start Xperf performance recording using this command:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">xperf -on PROC_THREAD+LOADER+Base -BufferSize 1024</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>When recording is done, the generated “*.etl” file can be opened and viewed in WPA.</p>

<h1 id="process-explorer">Process Explorer</h1>

<p>Lastly, I’d like to introduce a light-weight tool <strong>Process Explorer</strong>, aka. procexp. Process Explorer is included in Windows’ <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-utilities"><strong>Sysinternals Process Utilities</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Process Explorer provides a CPU performance monitor. Comparing to the CPU monitor in Task Manager, this one has enhanced features for you to monitor CPU utilization of each core and each thread. You can view a graph for each CPU.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2018/20180213-procexp_0.png" width="600" /></p>

    <link href="http://euccas.github.io/blog/20171203/effective-jenkins-plugins-1.html"/>
    <updated>2017-12-03T16:18:31-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20171203/effective-jenkins-plugins-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a>, originally founded in 2006 as “Hudson”, is one of the leading automation applications which support building, deploying and automating software projects. One great advantage of Jenkins is there are hundreds of plugins available which enable various kinds of extended features needed in the Continous Integration and Continuous Delivery process. As I just checked on the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/">Jenkins Plugins page</a>, there are 873 plugins that fall into five categories: Platforms, User interface, Administration, Source code management and Build management.</p>

<p>Effectively using Jenkins plugins makes your experience with Jenkins more productive. I’m going to occasionally write about Jenkins plugins that I used or learned about. The first post will start from some of the plugins I used when I worked on building a Continuous Delivery system last year (from 2015 to 2016).</p>

<h1 id="job-configuration-history">Job Configuration History</h1>

<p><a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/jobConfigHistory"><em>JobConfigHistory Plugin</em></a></p>

<p>This plugin saves every change made to a job. It allows you to see the history of job configurations, compare configuration differences, and restore a particular version of config. You can also see which user makes a particular change if you configured a security policy.</p>

<p>The configuration changes are saved by means of saving copies of the configuration file of a job (config.xml in Jenkins Home directory).</p>

<h1 id="dependency-graph-view">Dependency Graph View</h1>

<p><a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/depgraph-view"><em>Dependency Graph View Plugin</em></a></p>

<p>This plugin visualize dependencies of multiple jobs by generating graphs via <a href="https://graphviz.gitlab.io/">graphviz</a>. You can choose to show the dependency of jobs in a view. To generate the graph, it is required to have graphviz installed on the Jenkins server.</p>

<p>This plugin is very useful when you have many jobs which have dependency relationship. Visualizing the dependency helps you easily find possible mistakes in the setting of dependencies.</p>

<h1 id="build-timeout">Build Timeout</h1>

<p><a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-timeout"><em>Build-timeout Plugin</em></a></p>

<p>This plugin allows you to set runtime limit of jobs, and automatically abort a build if it’s taking longer than expected time. In my experience, this plugin was extremely useful as it solved the problem that some builds got stuck and didn’t release the Jenkins slave slots.</p>

<p>Noted this plugin isn’t applicable to pipelines.</p>

<h1 id="perforce">Perforce</h1>

<p><a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/P4+Plugin"><em>P4 Plugin</em></a></p>

<p>This plugin manages Perforce workspaces, synchronising code and polling/triggering builds. It also supports a few common Perforce operations such as credential authentication, changelists browsing, and labeling builds.</p>

<h1 id="jira">JIRA</h1>

<p><a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/jira"><em>JIRA Plugin</em></a></p>

<p>This plugin integrates <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a> to Jenkins. It uses JIRA REST API, and allows you to display Jenkins builds inside JIRA.</p>

<h1 id="parameterized-trigger">Parameterized Trigger</h1>

<p><a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/parameterized-trigger"><em>Parameterized Trigger Plugin</em></a></p>

<p>This plugin lets you trigger new builds with various ways of specifying parameters for the new builds. The parameters could be a set of predefined properties, or based on information/results of the upstream builds.</p>

<p>As an example, you can tell a build job where to find packages it needs to install.</p>

<h1 id="log-parser">Log Parser</h1>

<p><a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/log-parser"><em>Log Parser Plugin</em></a></p>

<p>This plugin parses the console log generated by the Jenkins build. It could highlight lines of interest in log, like the lines with <code>errors</code>, <code>warnings</code>, <code>information</code>. It divides a log into sections, such as <em>errors section</em>, <em>warnings section</em>, etc. The number of errors or warnings are also displayed. Useful for triaging errors in long build logs.</p>

<h1 id="email-extension">Email Extension</h1>

<p><a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/email-ext"><em>Email Extension Plugin</em></a></p>

<p>This plugin extends the email notification functionality that Jenkins provides. You can customize when an email is sent, who should receive it, and the content of the email.</p>

<h1 id="disk-usage">Disk Usage</h1>

<p><a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/disk-usage"><em>Disk-Usage Plugin</em></a></p>

<p>This plugin calculates disk usage of projects and builds, and shows the disk usage information on a page. It also displays a trend chart of display usage. It makes Jenkins job and workspace maintenance easier.</p>

<h1 id="thinbackup">ThinBackup</h1>

<p><a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/thinBackup"><em>ThinBackup Plugin</em></a></p>

<p>This plugin backs up the global and job specific configurations. You can see the backup history, and choose to restore a particular backup. The backup provides setting options for the backup schedule, backup directory, maximum number of backup sets, etc.</p>

<h1 id="scriptlermanaged-scripts">Scriptler/Managed Scripts</h1>

<p><a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Scriptler+Plugin"><em>Scriptler Plugin</em></a></p>

<p>This plugin allows you to edit, store, and resue groovy scripts, and execute the script on any of the slaves or nodes. But since 2016 the distribution of this plugin has been suspended due to security issues. <em>The current version of this plugin may not be safe to use</em>.</p>

<p>An alternative choice is the <a href="hhttps://plugins.jenkins.io/managed-scripts"><em>Managed Scripts Plugin</em></a>.</p>

    <link href="http://euccas.github.io/blog/20171129/python-why-decorators-are-useful.html"/>
    <updated>2017-11-29T22:41:51-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20171129/python-why-decorators-are-useful</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Python, by definition <em>decorators</em> are <em>functions</em> that <em>accept a function</em> as an argument, and <em>return a new function</em> as their return value. The reason why decorators exist in Python, but not in other similar language such as Ruby, is that <em>functions</em> are <em>objects</em> in Python. Functions can be assigned to variables and passed around the same as other object in Python. For example, a list can have functions as its elements, and functions can take other functions as arguments. Functions can be defined inside another function, and this forms closures.</p>

<h1 id="when-to-use-decorators">When to use decorators?</h1>

<p>It’s easy to understand what decorators are, while the real question you may have is: Why decorators are useful? When shall I use decorators in my Python program?</p>

<p>In some way, I see decorator functions are useful whenever you need process or extend the inputs or outputs of a given function (or more often, multiple functions) in some way you want. Here I list three usages of decorators that I can think of:</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="extend-the-functionality-of-your-functions">1. Extend the functionality of your functions</h2>

<p>Usually the extended functionalities are for some kind of enhancement, format changing, or temporary usage. In other words, you are adding some functionalities without touching the core logic of the original functions. A few common use cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Convert the output of your functions to another format, like JSON, YAML, etc.</li>
  <li>Add logging to your functions, or formatting the logging output</li>
  <li>Measure timing of your functions</li>
  <li>Count the time of function calls</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="add-caching-process-to-your-functions-to-make-them-faster">2. Add caching process to your functions, to make them faster</h2>

<p>When you have some functions which are possibly called for many times with the same input, you can write a decorator function that stores a cache of inputs and outputs of a given function. In this way, the function doesn’t need to re-compute everything each time, and make it faster to run it multiple times. This is related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization"><strong>Memoization technique</strong></a>.</p>

<h2 id="handle-exceptions">3. Handle exceptions</h2>

<p>You can use decorator functions to process exceptions. One example is supressing particular types of system exceptions raised by the target function. Another thing you can do is catching all exceptions raised by a function, prompt the user to ask what the program should act.</p>

<h1 id="two-examples">Two examples</h1>

<p>Now let me use two examples to describe the <strong>syntax</strong> of decorators.</p>

<h2 id="measure-timing">Measure timing</h2>

<p>This example comes from a good answer on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/490228/3109254">Stack Overflow, by user RSabet</a>.</p>

<p>A decorator function <code>time_dec</code> tells you how long it takes to finish a function. 
Python has a shortened syntax for using decorators which allows us to wrap a function in a decorator after we define it. This shortened syntax is syntactic sugar <code>@decorator_function</code>.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">res</span>
</span><span class="line">

</span><span class="line">    <span class="o">...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Note the syntactic sugar <code>@time_dec</code> was used. It causes Python to rebind the function name <code>myFunction</code> as:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h2 id="memoization">Memoization</h2>

<p>This example shows how we can add caching to the calculation of prime numbers.</p>

<p>A decorator function <code>memoize</code> is used to store inputs and calculate outputs of the original function <code>is_prime</code>.
The second time when you call function <code>is_prime</code> with the same input number, it runs much faster than the first time.</p>

<h1 id="built-in-decorators">Built-in decorators</h1>

<p>Python also has several built-in decorators, and you might see them before you know the term decorator. The built-in decorators are mainly used to annotate methods of a class: <code>@property</code>, <code>@classmethod</code>, <code>@staticmethod</code>.</p>

<p><strong>@property</strong>: transforms a method function into a descriptor. When applied to a method, it creates extra properties objects: <code>getter</code>, <code>setter</code>, and <code>deleter</code>. By using <code>@property</code>, we can access a method as if it was an attribute.</p>

<p><strong>@classmethod</strong>: transforms a method function into a class-level function.</p>

<p><strong>@staticmethod</strong>: transforms a method function into a class-level function, and neither the object instance nor the class is implicitly passed as the first argument.</p>

<p>As decorators are just ordinary functions and the decorator syntax is just a syntactic sugar, you can easily turn any Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html">built-in function</a> to a decorator if it makes sense to use it that way.</p>

<h1 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h1>

<p>One more thing, you may want to take a look at <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary">this PythonDecoratorLibaray page</a>. It collects a number of decorator examples and code pieces.</p>

    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170827/cpu-profiling-tools-on-linux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Profiling is an effective method to provide measurements for the performance of software applications. With profiling, you get fine grained information for the components of an application, such as how often a function is called, how long a routine takes to execute and how much time are spent of different spots in the code. With these information, you could identify the performance bottlenecks and the poorly implemented parts in a software application, and find effective methods to improve them.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll write a brief summary of two profiling methods: <strong>Instrumentation</strong> and <strong>Sampling</strong>, and four CPU profiling tools on Linux: <strong>perf</strong>, <strong>gprof</strong>, <strong>Valgrind</strong> and Google’s <strong>gperftools</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="profiling-methods">Profiling Methods</h1>

<p>Different profiling methods use different ways to measure the performance of an application when it is executed. <strong>Instrumentation</strong> and <strong>Sampling</strong> are the two categories that profiling methods fall into.</p>

<h2 id="instrumentation">Instrumentation</h2>

<p>Instrumentation method inserts special code at the beginning and end of each routine to record when the routine starts and ends. The time spent on calling other routines within a routine may also be recorded. The profiling result shows the actual time taken by the routine on each call.</p>

<p>There are two types of instrumenting profiler tools: <strong>source-code modifying</strong> profilers and <strong>binary profilers</strong>. Source-code modifying profilers insert the instrumenting code in the source code, while the binary profilers insert instrumentation into an application’s executable code once it is loaded in memory.</p>

<p>The good thing of instrumentation method is it gives you the actual time. The inserted instrumentation code (timer calls) take some time themselves. To reduce the impact of that, at the start of each run profilers measure the overhead incurred from the instrumenting process, and later subtract this overhead from the measurement result. But the instrumenting process could still significantly affect an application’s performance in some cases, for example when the routine is very short and frequently called, as the inserted instrumentation would disturb the way the routine executes in the CPU.</p>

<h2 id="sampling">Sampling</h2>

<p>Sampling measures applications without inserting any modifications. Sampling profilers record the executed instruction when the operating system interrupts the CPU at regular intervals to execute process switches, and correlates the recorded execution points with the routines and source code during the linking process. The profiling result shows the frequency with which a routine and source line is executing during the application’s run.</p>

<p>Sampling profilers causes little overhead to the application run process, and they work well on small and often-called routines. One drawback is the evaluations of time spent are statistical approximations rather than actual time. Also sampling could only tell what routine is executing currently, not where it was called from. As a result, sampling profilers can’t report call traces of an application.</p>

<h1 id="cpu-profiling-tools-on-linux">CPU Profiling Tools on Linux</h1>

<h2 id="perf">1. perf</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><strong>perf</strong></a> tool is provided by Linux kernel (2.6+) for profiling CPU and software events. You can get the tool installed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ubuntu: install <em>linux-tools_common</em></li>
  <li>Debian: install <em>linux-base</em></li>
  <li>Arch: install <em>perf-utils</em></li>
  <li>Fedora: install <em>perf</em></li>
</ul>

<p><code>perf</code> is based on the perf_events system, which is based on event-based sampling, and it uses CPU performance counters to profile the application. It can instrument hardware counters, static tracepoints, and dynamic tracepoints. It also provide per task, per CPU and per-workload counters, sampling on top of these and source code event annotation. It does <em>not</em> instrument the code, so that it has a really fast speed and generates precise results.</p>

<p>You can use <code>perf</code> to profile with <code>perf record</code> and <code>perf report</code> commands:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">perf record -g &lt;app&gt; &lt;options&gt;
</span><span class="line">perf report</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The <code>perf record</code> command collects samples and generates an output file called <code>perf.data</code>. This file can then be analyzed using <code>perf report</code> and <code>perf annotate</code> commands. Sampling frequency can be specified with <code>-F</code> option. As an example, <code>perf record -F 1000</code> means 1000 samples per second.</p>

<h2 id="gprof">2. gprof</h2>

<p>GNU profiler <a href="https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/"><strong>gprof</strong></a> tool uses a hybrid of instrumentation and sampling. Instrumentation is used to collect function call information, and sampling is used to gather runtime profiling information.</p>

<p>Using <code>gprof</code> to profile your applications requires the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compile and link the application with <code>-pg</code> option</li>
  <li>Execute the application to generate a profile data file, default file name is <code>gmon.out</code></li>
  <li>Run <code>gprof</code> command to analyze the profile data</li>
</ol>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">g++ -pg myapp.cpp -o myapp.o
</span><span class="line">./myapp.o
</span><span class="line">gprof myapp.o  </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The <code>gprof</code> command prints a flat profile and a call graph on standard output. The flat profile shows how much time was spent executing directly in each function. The call graph shows which functions called which others, and how much time each function used when its subroutine calls are included. You can use the supported options <a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gprof-2.9.1/html_mono/gprof.html#SEC4">listed here</a> to control <code>gprof</code> output styles, such as enabling line-by-line analysis and annotated source.</p>

<h2 id="valgrind-callgrind">3. Valgrind Callgrind</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.valgrind.org/"><strong>Valgrind</strong></a> is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. Valgrind distribution includes six production-quality tools that can detect memory issues and profile programs. <strong>Callgrind</strong>, built as an extension to <strong>Cachegrind</strong>, provides function call call-graph. A separated visualisation tool <a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi/KcacheGrindIndex"><strong>KCachegrind</strong></a> could also be used to visualize Callgrind’s output.</p>

<p>Valgrind is a CPU emulator. The technology behind Valgrind is Dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI), whereby the analysis code is added to the original code of the client program at run-time. The profiling tool Callgrind is simulation based, it uses Valgrind as a runtime instrumentation framework. The following two papers explain how Valgrind and Callgrind work in detail.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.valgrind.org/docs/valgrind2007.pdf">Valgrind: A Framework for Heavyweight Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (<em>Nicholas Nethercote and Julian Seward</em>)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.valgrind.org/docs/callgrind2004.pdf">A Tool Suite for Simulation Based Analysis of Memory Access Behavior (<em>Josef Weidendorfer, Markus Kowarschik and Carsten Trinitis</em>)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You need use the following commands to profile your program with <code>valgrind</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Build your program as usual, no need adding any special compiler or linker flags</li>
  <li>Execute the program with callgrind tool to generate a profile data file, default file name is <code>callgrind.out.&lt;pid&gt;</code></li>
  <li>View the generated profile data with <code>callgrind_annotate</code> or <code>kcachegrind</code> tool</li>
</ol>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

</span><span class="line">callgrind_annotate callgrind.out.&lt;pid&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<h2 id="gperftools">4. gperftools</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools"><strong>gperftools</strong></a>, originally “Google Performance Tools”, is a collection of tools for analyzing and improving performance of multi-threaded applications. It offers a fast malloc, a thread-friendly heap-checker, a heap-profiler, and a cpu-profiler. gperftools was developed and tested on x86 Linux systems, and it works in its full generality only on those systems. Some of the libraries and functionality have been ported to other Unix systems and Windows.</p>

<p>To use the CPU profiler in gperftools, you need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the gperftools, following the instructions <a href="https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools">here</a></li>
  <li>Include gperftools header file in your application’s source files, and compile the application</li>
  <li>Link the library into an application with <code>-lprofiler</code></li>
  <li>Set enrionement variable <code>CPUPROFILE</code>, then run the application</li>
  <li>Analyze the output with <code>pprof</code> commands</li>
</ol>

<p>Include gperftools header files in your source file:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">#include "gperftools-2.6.1/src/gperftools/profiler.h"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Link with <code>-lprofiler</code>, <code>profiler</code> is in the installation directory of <code>gperftools</code>:</p>

    <link href="http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170627/facebook-infrastructure-streaming-video-engine-sve.html"/>
    <updated>2017-06-27T22:16:02-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170627/facebook-infrastructure-streaming-video-engine-sve</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In last year’s <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/videos/?category=f8_2016"><strong>Facebook F8 conference</strong></a>, Sachin Kulkarni, who worked on Facebook’s Video Infrastructure, gave a talk (<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/videos/f8-2016/inside-look-at-facebook-media-infrastructure/">watch it here</a>) to introduce the design of Facebook’s <strong>Streaming Video Engine System (SVE)</strong>. I found this talk particularly interesting because it revealed, in a very well structured, concise yet informative way, how Facebook infrastructure team came up with a solution to build a video system solving user frustrations by reviewing the end-to-end process, and how such a design meet the goal of being <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>flexible</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong>, and <strong>efficient</strong>. After watching the presentation video for a few times, I thought it would be helpful to write down some notes here, for my own reviewing in the future, and for people who might be interested in Facebook’s media infrastructure.</p>

<p>Sharing on Facebook started from largely text, and quickly changed to be largely photos. Since 2014, more videos started to be posted and shared among users. The challenge was, building a video processing system is much harder than building a text or image processing system. Videos are greedy, they will consume all your resources: CPU, memory, disk, network, and anything else.</p>

<p>Before building the Streaming Video Engine system, the team started by reviewing Facebook’s existing video uploading and processing process, which was slow and not scalable. They found several problems need change or improvement:</p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
  <li>No unified clients</li>
  <li>Several disk reads and writes in the critical path</li>
  <li>Was doing serial processing throughout</li>
  <li>Read a video as one single big file, instead of splitting it up to chunks</li>
</ul>

<p>The new Streaming Video Engine (SVE) is expected to solve the aforementioned problems, and to meet the four design goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fast: make users upload their videos super fast</li>
  <li>Flexible: usable for different Facebook products</li>
  <li>Scalable: everything at Facebook has to scale</li>
  <li>Efficient: storage efficiency, processing efficiency, and more importantly consume less bytes of users’ data plan</li>
</ul>

<p>These four design goals, in my opinion, are also the most common goals applicable to most engineering infrastructure systems.</p>

<p>Let’s take a deep dive to see how SVE was designed to meet these goals.</p>

<h1 id="fast">Fast</h1>

<ul>
  <li>First step is build a common library (for video uploading) that could be used for the clients cross platforms (Web, Mobile, Android, etc.). With the common library, optimizations on video uploading can be applied to all platforms.</li>
  <li>The uploading library has functions to split a video by GOP (Group of Pictures, a GOP roughly is a scene in the video) alignment. So any given video can be split to segments, which can have multiple GOPs.</li>
  <li>Uploading process starts as soon as the clients split a video into segaments. The <strong>client</strong> uploads one segment a time to the <strong>web server</strong>.</li>
  <li>Web server sends out segments to the <strong>preprocessor</strong>, which is a write-through cache.</li>
  <li>Proprocessor handles:
    <ul>
      <li>Normalize the video (segment) if it needs to</li>
      <li>Notify the <strong>scheduler</strong> that there are video segments available to be encoded</li>
      <li>Write the video (segment) to the <strong>original storage</strong></li>
      <li>Further split the video segment into GOPs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scheduler will find workers to encode videos. Multiple works can be utilized and each worker will process one or multiple GOPs.</li>
  <li>Overlapped upload and encoding process: While proprocessor, scheduler and works are working, the uploading process is still ongoing. Clients continues splitting videos into segments and uploading to the web server.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2017/20170627-fb_00.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>With this design, the process speedup reached 2.3x (small videos &lt; 3MB) ~ 9.3x (large videos &gt; 1G).</p>

<h1 id="flexible">Flexible</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The key insight that allows SVE to be flexible is, all the video processing pipelines can be represented as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).</li>
  <li>Arbitrary dependencies can be added between the tasks in the video processing pipepline. The added tasks can be executed in parallel while the main pipeline tasks are running.</li>
  <li>SVE provides very simple API functions for the video pipeline (Ideally, you can add a video processing pipeline in your product in less than 10 lines of code).</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2017/20170627-fb_01.png" width="600" /></p>

<h1 id="scalable">Scalable</h1>

<ul>
  <li>SVE was designed to prepare for overloads, such as handling the worldwide uploading “spike” on New Year’s Eve (could be 3x video uploads).</li>
  <li>Building a scalable system is relevant only when the system is <strong>robust</strong>. When the system gets overloaded, it must <strong>gracefully degrade</strong>. It cannot crash and burn.</li>
  <li>Prepare for overload along two dimensions: at the pipeline level, and the task level.</li>
  <li>Pipeline level, when uploads overwhelm the system:
    <ul>
      <li>Do not cache original videos in upload: Preprocessor stops caching original videos. Workers then need fetch videos from the original storage, not from preprocessor. The cost here is disk latency is added to the critical path.</li>
      <li>Delay pipeline generation for incoming video. Distinguish the critical video pipeline requests and the non-critical ones, then delay the non-critical ones.</li>
      <li>Reroute traffic to a different (less busy) region (Asia, Europe, US west, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Task level (the tasks executed by <strong>workers</strong> in the pipeline), when too many tasks are running:
    <ul>
      <li>Push back non latency-sensitive jobs</li>
      <li>Turn off A/B tests, which try to figure out the best encoding for the given video</li>
      <li>Add more workers (this requires making it easy to add capacity to SVE)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="efficient">Efficient</h1>

<ul>
  <li>The high level problem statement here is: If we could use 100% CPU, how can we make the encoded video as small as possible?</li>
  <li>Find the optimal encoding settings to get the best balance between encoded video file size and time spent on encoding. The difficult part is modern encoders can have hundreds of settings for one video. Chance of picking optimal combination is extremely low.</li>
  <li>The adopted solution is:
    <ul>
      <li>Categorize each scene such as “minimal motion”, “rapid movement”, and “complex crowded scene”.</li>
      <li>Build a Neural Network Model and a large training data set to train the network.</li>
      <li>In SVE, video scene segments are sent to a Fingerprint generator, which generates fingerprints and sends them to the Neural Network Model.</li>
      <li>The neural network figures out optimal encoding settings (could be multiple) for each scene, and sends the encoding settings to encoders.</li>
      <li>the encoder takes the settings, and encodes the video scenes in multiple ways. Then discard the encoded videos which are below quality bar.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2017/20170627-fb_02.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>SVE achieved 20% smaller video file sizes. This is a huge saving of user’s data plans.</p>

<p>This Streaming Video Engine was designed, coded and tested in roughly 9 months. The most important learnings are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>E2E view: To find an optimal solution, we need look at the flow end to end</li>
  <li>Multi-dimensional flexibility is a key for making the system most useful</li>
  <li>Parallel and shadow mode testing to find correctness and scalability issues before production</li>
  <li>Design the ability to handle extreme products such as 360 videos</li>
  <li>Track direct measures (latency, reliability, etc.) and indirect measures (number of videos uploaded, watch times, etc.). Mapping indirect measures to direct measures could give you a good view in figuring out what you could do better next.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170616/how-instagram-moved-to-python-3.html"/>
    <updated>2017-06-16T17:52:34-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170616/how-instagram-moved-to-python-3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instagram, the famous brunch sharing app, presented in <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2017/">PyCon 2017</a> and gave a talk in the keynote session on “How Instagram moves to Python 3”. If you have 15 minutes, read the interview with the speakers, Hui Ding and Lisa Guo from Instagram Infrastructure team, <a href="https://thenewstack.io/instagram-makes-smooth-move-python-3/]"><strong>here</strong></a>. If you have 45 minutes, watch their PyCon talk video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66XoCk79kjM"><strong>here</strong></a>. If you have only 5 minutes, continue reading, <strong>right here</strong>.</p>

<p>Instagram’s backend, which serves over 400 million active users every day, is built on Python/Django stack. The decision on whether moving from Python 2 to Python 3, was really a decision on whether investing in a version of the language that was mature, but wasn’t going anywhere (Python 2 is expected to retire in 2020) – or the language that was the next version and had great and growing community support. The major motivations behind Instagram’s migration to Python 3 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Typing support</strong> for dev velocity</li>
  <li>Better <strong>performance</strong> than Python 2</li>
  <li><strong>Community</strong> continues to make Python 3 better and faster</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole migration process took about 10 months, in roughly 3 stages.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2017/20170616-instagram_python3_00.png" width="520" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>First off, the migration was done directly on the Master Branch, which means the developers were adding new features to the code while migration was ongoing. So in the beginning of the Mirgration process, infrastructure added support of Python 3 on the Master Branch to make the code be able to run with both Python 2 and Python 3 environment.</li>
  <li>Massive code modification for 3 months, with the help of Python package <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/modernize"><strong>“modernize”</strong></a>. Meanwhile, upgraded Third-party packages to Python 3 (working rule: <em>No Python 3, no new package</em>). Also deleted unused, incompatible packages.</li>
  <li>Intensive unit testing for 2 months. One limitation is data compatibility issues typically do not show up in unit tests.</li>
  <li>Production rollout for another 4 months (push Python 3 to every developer’s sandbox)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the talk, Lisa shared the challenges they faced in the migration process and how did they solved those problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Differences in <strong>unicode</strong>, <strong>str</strong>, <strong>bytes</strong>. Solved by using helper functions.</li>
  <li><strong>Pickle memcache data format incompatibility</strong> in Python 2 and Python 3. Solved by isolating memcaches for Python 2 and Python 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Iterator</strong> differences, such as <code>map</code>. Solved by converting all maps to list in Python 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Dictionary order</strong> is different in different Python versions, which caused differences in the dumped JSON data. Solved by forcing <code>sorted_keys</code> in <code>json.dump</code> function.</li>
  <li>With Python 3, while CPU instructions per request decreased by 12%, max requests per second (capacity) had 0% increase! Found the root cause in the code of checking memory configuration, and the issue was memory optimization condition was never met in Python 3 as <code>True</code> because of unicode issue. Solved by adding a magical character <strong>“b”</strong>, just like this:</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2017/20170616-instagram_python3_01.png" width="520" /></p>

<p>In Feb 2017, Instagram’s stack completely dropped Python 2 and moved to Python 3 (v3.6). So far they’ve got this from Python 3:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2017/20170616-instagram_python3_02.png" width="520" /></p>

<p>One more thing, in the talk Hui Ding also briefly discussed a few <strong>Python Efficiency Strategies</strong> that Instagram used to support the growing number of features and users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build extensive tools to profile and understand perf bottleneck</li>
  <li>Proactively push stable, critical components to C/C++, e.g., memcached access library</li>
  <li>Use Cythonization to improve performance</li>
  <li>Future ideas: Make the Django stack completely Async? Create a new python runtime?</li>
</ul>

<p>Changing an existing service to use a new version of language can never be easy, especially when your service is at such a scale - serving millions of people. You just cannot afford to breaking the existing service. Moving to Python 3 in 10 months must be a challenging process. “It can be done. It worths it. Make it happen. And Make Python 3 better.”</p>

<p>Nice work Instagram!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[CMake: Use the Correct Options to Solve Linker Errors]]></title>
    <link href="http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170529/cmake-linker-options.html"/>
    <updated>2017-05-29T22:30:46-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170529/cmake-linker-options</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago when I worked on a project using <a href="https://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> to compress and decompress files, I once met linker errors complaining about unable to resolve symbols of zlib functions:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">cannot resolve symbols _gzbuffer, _gzopen, ...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>In the end I fixed these linker errors by using <code>TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES</code> command in the project’s CMakefile to specify the linker package dependency, as the following:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(myProject zlibstatic)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>When I was looking for solutions to fix those linker errors, I found several related CMake commands which look quite similar and could be confusing in terms of their functions and when to use them. Here is a quick summary of these commands.</p>

<p>Related CMake commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add_dependencies</li>
  <li>link_directories</li>
  <li>link_libraries</li>
  <li>target_link_libraries</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="adddependencies">ADD_DEPENDENCIES</h1>

<p>Usage: <code>add_dependencies(&lt;target&gt; ...)</code></p>

<p>ADD_DEPENDENCIES adds a dependency between top-level targets. It makes a top level target depend on other top level targets to ensure that the dependents build beforehand. This command doesn’t ensure CMake to find the path to the targets though.</p>

<h1 id="linkdirectories">LINK_DIRECTORIES</h1>

<p>Usage: <code>link_directories(directory1 directory2 ...)</code></p>

<p>LINK_DIRECTORIES specifies directories in which the linker will look for libraries. This command will apply only to targets created after it is called. This command is rarely necessary. You can always pass absolute paths to target_link_libraries() command instead.</p>

<p>The function of this command is similar to <code>-L</code> option in g++. It is also similar to adding the specified directories to environment variable <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.</p>

<h1 id="linklibraries">LINK_LIBRARIES</h1>

<p>Usage: <code>link_libraries([item1 [item2 [...] ]])</code></p>

<p>LINK_LIBRARIES specifies link libraries or flags to use when linking all targets added later by commands such as <code>add_executables()</code> or <code>add_library()</code>.</p>

<p>This command was deprecated in CMake version 3.0, and was added back in version 3.2. But CMake document recommends using <code>target_link_libraries</code> to replace this command whenever possible.</p>

<p>The link libraries specified in this command are expected to be full paths.</p>

<h1 id="targetlinklibraries">TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES</h1>

<p>Usage: <code>target_link_libraries(&lt;target&gt; ... &lt;item&gt; ...)</code></p>

<p>TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES specifies libraries or flags to use when linking a given target and/or its dependents. The specified target must be created by <code>add_library()</code> within the project or as an imported library.</p>

    <updated>2017-04-22T23:24:14-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170422/on-wechat-mini-program</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>现在流传的中国互联网圈四大热点是：百度的丑闻，支付宝的社交，微信的功能和网易的猪肉。这大概是个调侃的笑话，但是其中“微信的功能”，确实是我会特别留意和关心的，原因在于两点：</p>

<ol>
  <li>对微信产品设计的认可和关注</li>
  <li>对张小龙产品设计理念的好奇与学习</li>
</ol>

<p>最近几个月来微信最引人注目的功能变化，无疑是“微信小程序”的推出和初步推广。微信小程序，英文版名称为Mini Program，其实是微信推出的类似于React和Weex的以Javascript为基础的程序框架。微信小程序为开发者提供了各种UI组件和调用底层的API。通过小程序实现的App，无需安装就可以在微信平台使用。</p>

<p>微信小程序的入口，设置在微信底部4个固定Tab之一的”发现“菜单中。从功能上来看，微信小程序的入口类似于Apple App Store，但它的设计和App Store完全不同。下面是一些比较。</p>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="section">入口主界面</h1>

<p>用户第一次进入微信小程序的入口时，看到的有且仅有一个搜索框，其它就是空白。这显著不同于进入App Store后看到的各种玲琅满目的应用和排行榜。</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2017/20170423-wechat_miniprogram_00.png" width="360" /></p>

<h1 id="section-1">使用小程序</h1>

<p>通过搜索（或者其他二维码）入口找到一个小程序后，一次点击就直接开始了使用过程，没有安装，也没有App启动界面和过程。第一次和小程序交互时甚至会不习惯这个没有暂停的过程。我特别注意到的是，这个点击即使用的过程，也会影响到小程序App本身的入口设计，比如用注册登录作为主入口就不合适了，小程序App需要在最短的时间内提供有效的信息和功能给用户。</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2017/20170423-wechat_miniprogram_01.png" width="360" />
<img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2017/20170423-wechat_miniprogram_02.png" width="360" /></p>

<h1 id="section-2">退出小程序</h1>

<p>退出一个使用中的小程序，是通过微信左上方的后退按钮。退出之后即回到搜索结果的页面。感觉上，好像刚刚什么都没有发生。而使用过的小程序，都会被保存在入口主界面搜索框下的列表中。列表可以手工逐项清除，删除方式和删除微信对话一样，左滑屏幕，选择删除。</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2017/20170423-wechat_miniprogram_03.png" width="360" /></p>

<p>微信小程序入口的这些特点，可以说是再一次充分展现了微信产品设计一直以来的风格，也即张小龙曾经讲过的关于微信背后的产品观。根据我所观察到的，总结一下有：</p>

<p><em>(微信的设计部分，引用自张小龙谈微信产品观；小程序的部分是我的总结)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>微信：让用户”聊完就走”。小程序：让用户“用完就走”。</li>
  <li>微信：让不上微博的用户来用你的产品。小程序：可能是让懒得装App的用户来用你的小程序。</li>
  <li>微信：大部分的新功能是可以砍掉的；只抓主场景，不做全功能，做多源于不自信。小程序：你看到的只有一个搜索框。</li>
  <li>微信：需求来自于对信息流的理解，让品牌通过朋友传播。小程序：二维码入口。</li>
  <li>微信：PC上的入口在搜索框，手机上的入口在二维码。小程序：入口是搜索框，可以通过二维码（来自朋友，公众号，印刷品分享）直接进入小程序。</li>
  <li>微信：设计就是分类，越简单的分类越容易被接受，微信的结构和界面保持简单。小程序：甚至没有分类，界面特别特别简单！</li>
  <li>微信：去除人们在QQ上说”88”的习惯。小程序：去除人们安装App，删除App的习惯</li>
  <li>微信：让功能存在于无形之中；只有新手才将所有（新）功能罗列在显眼的地方。小程序：什么功能都没有罗列，来了就用，用完就走！</li>
  <li>总结：极简才能不被超越。关于这一点，根据《腾讯传》中的描述，马化腾和张小龙解释说，把产品设计做到极简，这样如果你要抄我们的产品，就会加东西，而一旦加了东西，就不如我们的产品了。</li>
</ul>

<p>现在微信小程序的热度还不高，处于一个开发者仍在观望的状态，加之最近Apple的封锁打赏事件，更让不少唱衰小程序的论调流传起来。而无论小程序未来发展会如何，我在体验它之后立刻感受到设计的用心。在互联网和移动产品的茫茫大海之中探索，我发现，有些产品会让你觉得不明白设计者在想什么（可能是不存在），有些产品让你想吐槽设计者怎么连这个都想不到，有些产品让你觉得设计者好机智，而还有一些产品，会让你为设计者的用心良苦而感动。对我来说，微信是属于最后一类产品，虽然它其貌不扬（也不洋，挺土的）。</p>

<p>2017-4-24 补充：</p>

<p>一个产品的成功当然不仅仅是由设计决定的，而产品的设计也绝不仅仅限于UX的范围。考虑几个简单的问题：</p>

<ul>
  <li>如果微信的UI不变，但是发送消息有延迟或丢失，平均每周发生一次。你还会用微信吗？</li>
  <li>如果微信的功能和性能都不变，而UI变为类似于微博，你还会用微信吗？</li>
  <li>如果每次你赞了朋友或者收藏了文章，都会出现在朋友们的时间线上，类似于Facebook，你还会用微信吗？</li>
  <li>如果微信的UI，功能和性能都和现在相同，但你的家人，朋友，同事都在用Facebook，你还会用微信吗？</li>
</ul>

<p>一个成功产品的设计值得分析，一个原因是成功产品的设计通常不差，更重要的是它已经成为了相当多数量的人们习惯的方式。无论你是想要迎合人们的习惯，或改变人们的习惯，观察和分析明星产品都是必要的。</p>

    <updated>2017-02-27T20:39:46-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170227/string-in-c-plus-plus</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I spent a whole lot of time on file compression and decompression with zlib. Thought I’d better write something about it. But before that, let me finish the review of C++ fundamentals. Today I’ll write about Strings in C++.</p>

<p>Two types of String are available in C++: C-Strings (C-style Strings), and STL Strings.</p>

<h1 id="c-string">C-String</h1>

<p>C-String is a fundamental type in C++. Comparing to STL String, C-String is small, simple and fast. A C-String is a special case of an array of characters terminated with a 0. This is sometimes called an null-terminated string. A C-String can be printed out with a <code>printf</code> statement using the <code>%s</code> format string. We can access the individual characters in a C-String just as we do in an array.</p>

<p><strong>Example: print a C-String with %s</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example: access characters of a C-String, C++ 11 style</strong></p>

<p>In C++ 11, a <em>range based loop</em> can be used to access arrays and also C-Strings.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class="line">    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Char is %c</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">cp</span><span class="p">);</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="c1">// Char is:</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>You may have noticed that the <code>null</code> character in the end of the C-String was printed out in the above code snippet. This is because the <em>range based for loop</em> in C++ 11 looks at the entire array and doesn’t treat the <code>null</code> as the end of the C-String. To get rid of the ending <code>null</code> character in a C-String, we need add a condition checker inside the range based loop.</p>

<h1 id="stl-string">STL String</h1>

<p>The STL String class is a special type of container designed to operate with sequence of characters. It’s designed with many <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/">features and available functions</a> to operate on strings efficiently and intuitively. To use STL String, you need include <code>string</code> header. The following example shows the basic usage of STL string including getting the length of a string, string concatenation, comparison, and accessing each character.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post was written in 2013, when I thought it was necessary to summarize infrastructure tools and flows needed in SoC design and verification, according to all my experience. Today when I checked on my old notes I found this one and would like to share it here. Later on I’ll update and expand this list according to my latest experience and knowledge in engineering tools and infrastructure for software and hardware development.</em></p>

<p>System-on-Chip design and verification process is a complicated one. Unlike the world of Web and Internet, the design and development of hardware products have higher risk and lower tolerance to any mistakes. SoC design and verification process requires collaborations from multiple teams and vendors. Lots of hard decisions to make. Lots of trade-offs to consider. Moreover, the nonrecurring-engineering (NRE) charge makes sufficient and solid verification a must with limited time and resource. Tools and automated flows are an essential part of any design house.</p>

<p>Here is a list of areas that need tools and flows for SoC software and hardware design and verification according to my experience.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pointers and references are two fundamental data types in C++. They are useful, common and somewhat dangerous. Using them correctly, they could greatly improve the efficiency and performance of your program. On the other hand, using them incorrectly could lead to many problems such as memory leaks and buffer overflow.</p>

<h1 id="pointers">Pointers</h1>

<p>A pointer holds the address of a variable and can be used to perform any operation that could be directly done on the variable, such as accessing and modifying it. Here are a few facts of pointers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When a pointer is defined, memory is allocated in the size of a pointer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pointer is strongly typed, meaning the compiler retains an association with a pointer that it points to a type of value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two pointers can equal to each other, such that changing one’s value also changes the other’s value.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The size of a pointer varies depending on the architecture: 32 bits on a 32-bit machine and 64 bits on a 64-bit machine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pointer subtraction is allowed. The result of pointer subtraction is the distance of two pointers.</p>

<h1 id="references">References</h1>

<p>A reference is another name for a pre-existing object. It does not have memory of its own. In other words, a reference is only an alias. A few facts about references are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot create a reference without specifying where in memory it refers to. A reference cannot be null.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A reference is immutable. You cannot reassign a reference to another piece of memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you use references in function calls and class method calls, you always want to make them const. This helps to eliminate the side effects of using references (because using reference sometimes is not obvious as using pointers, and people may not notice the unintended side effects could happen). The following example shows the possible side effects when using references:</p>

<h1 id="functions-call-by-reference">Functions: Call by Reference</h1>

<p>By default, functions in C++ pass variables by value, which means that a copy of the value is made and that copy is used inside the function. This is called <strong>pass by value</strong>. However, passing references or pointers does the same thing and faster as the copying is skipped. Actually this is why references are created for C++, to allow <strong>call by reference</strong> so that you can pass large objects without worrying about stack overflow.</p>

<p>Before references, this can be done with pointers. Pass by pointers can do the same thing but it’s a little bit more complicated than using references.</p>

<p>Example of a “call by reference”:</p>

    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170130/c-plus-plus-qualifiers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I’m doing a review on C++ programming language. During the process, I found a few topics which are worth paying more attention to. I’ll write several posts about the related C++ tips and tactics.</p>

<p>The first topic I’ll write about here is: <strong>Qualifiers</strong></p>

<p>C++ uses Qualifiers to adjust qualities of a variable or an object. In C++, there are two types of qualifiers: CV qualifiers and storage qualifiers.</p>

<h1 id="cv-qualifiers">CV Qualifiers</h1>

<p>CV qualifiers stands for Const and Volatile Qualifier. There are three types of CV qualifiers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>const</li>
  <li>volatile</li>
  <li>mutable</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="const-qualifier">const qualifier</h2>

<p><code>const</code> marks a variable or function as read-only or immutable. It’s value (or the return value of a function) cannot be changed once it’s been defined.</p>

<h2 id="volatile-qualifier">volatile qualifier</h2>

<p><code>volatile</code> marks a variable that may be <strong>changed by another process</strong>. This is generally used for threaded code, or externally linked code. Often <code>volatile</code> is used to tell the compiler avoid aggressive optimization involving the qualified object because the value of the object might be changed by means that the compiler is not aware of.</p>

<h1 id="storage-qualifiers">Storage Qualifiers</h1>

<p>Storage qualifiers determine the lifetime of the defined variables or functions. By default, a variable defined within a block has automatic lifetime, which is the duration of the block. There are three types of storage qualifiers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>static</li>
  <li>register</li>
  <li>extern</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="static-qualifier">static qualifier</h2>

<p><code>static</code> marks the variable is alive for the duration of the program. Static variables are commonly used for keeping <strong>state</strong> between instances of a given function or method. Static variables are stored globally, even if they are stored in a class.</p>

<h2 id="register-qualifier">register qualifier</h2>

<p><code>register</code> marks the variables as register variables, which are stored in processor registers. Register variables are faster and easier to access and operate on. Note using <code>register</code> only suggest the compiler that particular automatic variables should be allocated to CPU registers, if possible. The compiler may or may not actually store the variable in a register. Register variables should only be used if you have a detailed knowledge of the architecture and compiler for the computer you are using.</p>

<h2 id="extern-qualifier">extern qualifier</h2>

<p><code>extern</code> defines the variables or functions in a separate translation unit and are linked with the code by the linker step of the compiler. In other words, you can <strong>define</strong> variables or functions in some source files or classes, and use them in other source files/classes by using <code>extern</code> qualifier to <strong>declare</strong> them in other source files or classes.</p>

    <link href="http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170115/c-plus-plus-functors.html"/>
    <updated>2017-01-15T20:20:07-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20170115/c-plus-plus-functors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <strong>functor</strong> is a powerful C++ entity that everyone who wants to master C++ needs to know. A functor, which is short for “<strong>function object</strong>”, is a C++ class that acts like a function. Functors can be called using the familiar function call syntax, and can yield values and accept parameters just like regular functions.</p>

<p>To create a functor, we create a class (or a struct) that overloads the function <code>operator()</code>. Note here the function is called <code>operator()</code>, and it’s not the <code>operator</code> function, i.e. <code>()</code>. We then create an instance of this class (or struct) to use the created functor.</p>

<h1 id="create-and-use-functors">Create and use functors</h1>

<p>Let’s look at two examples of creating and using a functor. In the first example, a functor is created with a <code>class</code>, and in the second example we use a <code>struct</code> to create the functor.</p>

<h1 id="functors-access-class-data-members">Functors access class data members</h1>

<p>The key difference between a function and a functor is that a functor’s function call operator is a <em>member function</em> whereas a raw C++ function is a <em>free</em> function. This means that a functor can access the following information when being called:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Its local variables</li>
  <li>Its parameters</li>
  <li>Global variables</li>
  <li><strong>Class data members</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If a functor’s <code>operator()</code> member function requires access to data beyond what can be communicated by its parameters, we can store that information as a data member inside the functor class. Since <code>operator()</code> is a member of the functor class, it can then access that data freely. The following example shows how a functor’s <code>operator()</code> function access the class’s private member <code>toAppend</code>.</p>

<h1 id="functors-are-useful-in-stl-algorithms">Functors are useful in STL algorithms</h1>

<p>C++ STL algorithms use functors to increase the flexibility and efficiency. The most common uses for function objects are for generating data, for testing data, and for applying operations to data. here is an example of how STL <code>for_each</code> uses functors.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So here comes 2017, a year when you hear people talk about the words <em>Machine Learning</em>, <em>Reinforcement Learning</em>, and <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> everywhere.</p>

<p>Last year when Mark Zuckberg was working on building Jarvis, I didn’t spend much time on AI or Machine Learning. But I know the efforts I made last year get me ready to start on it right now.</p>

<p>Tonight I just talked to a former colleague who is working at Nvidia, and he gave me a few helpful suggestions about getting started on machine learning according to his own experience. Here are some of his advices:</p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
  <li>Set a goal: What do you want to achieve with the knowledge of Machine Learning?</li>
  <li>Learn the fundamentals: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Andrew Ng’s course</a> on Coursera</li>
  <li>If you’d like to have more courses, take <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/">Standford CS231n</a></li>
  <li>Learn to use the frameworks: <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensor Flow</a>, <a href="http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/">Caffe</a></li>
  <li>Work on projects with real data (very important): get from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle.com</a></li>
  <li>Follow <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a></li>
  <li>Master Python if you haven’t</li>
  <li>Make sure your computer has a powerful GPU :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people I know might think Machine Learning or AI is sort of irrelevant to what I’m working on. That’s not what I think though. Even if it is irrelevant today, it will become relevant sooner than expected. Machine Learning is not a fad. It’s the way how technology works tomorrow. If you can’t master it, at least you need have a good understanding of it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Python’s GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) was designed to be a thread-safe mechanism, and it effectively prevents conflicts between multiple threads. GIL makes it easy to implemente multi-threading with Python. However, it also prevents Python multi-threading from utilizing the multiple cores of a computer to achieve improved execution speed. This is why using the <code>threading</code> module in Python won’t help your program run faster through parallelism.</p>

<p>The good thing is Python provides a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/multiprocessing.html"><code>multiprocessing</code> module</a> since Python 2.6. With the <code>multiprocessing</code> module we can spawn subprocesses and effectively avoid some of the limitations that GIL brings, on both Unix and Windows platforms.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll briefly introduce <code>multiprocess</code> module and show how it can be used for parallel programming.</p>

<h1 id="a-simple-example-of-multiprocessing">A simple example of <em>multiprocessing</em></h1>

<p>In the following example, we use <code>multiprocessing</code> module to spawn a child process from a parent process using a <code>Process</code> object.</p>

<p>The program starts the subprocess using <code>p.start()</code></p>

<h1 id="three-ways-to-start-a-process">Three ways to start a process</h1>

<p>Depending on the platform, <code>multiprocessing</code> supports three ways to start a process.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>spawn</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Available on both Unix and Windows. The default on Windows. The parent process starts a fresh python interpreter process. Slower comparing with <code>fork</code> or <code>forkserver</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>fork</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Parent process uses <code>os.fork()</code> to fork the Python interpreter. The child process is identical to the parent process, with inheritating all resources of the parent process. Available on Unix only. The default of Unix.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>forkserver</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Starts a server process. Whenever a new process is needed, the parent process connects to the server and requests that it fork a new process. Available on Unix.</p>

<p>To select a start method, you can use <code>set_start_method()</code>. This method should be used only once in the program.</p>

<h1 id="two-ways-to-exchange-objects-between-processes">Two ways to exchange objects between processes</h1>

<p>Two types of communication channel between processes are supported in <code>multiprocessing</code>, and they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>class Queue</li>
  <li>function Pipe()</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need know more details, the Python document <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/multiprocessing.html#exchanging-objects-between-processes">here</a> will provide help.</p>

<h1 id="use-a-pool-of-workers">Use a pool of workers</h1>

<p>The <code>Pool</code> class is a quite useful one in the <code>multiprocessing</code> module, as in real life you’ll often need multiple workers to execute the tasks in your program in parallel. What the <code>Pool</code> class represents is a pool of workers. The following example shows how to create a pool with 4 processes as workers, and assign tasks to the workers.</p>

<p>The <code>apply_async(f, args, kwargs)</code> method calls a function for many times, or calls a number of different functions asynchronously with arguments arguments. Each process will NOT block other processes. The order of the multiple processes are not guaranteed.</p>

<p>The <code>close()</code> prevents any more tasks from being submitted to the pool. Once all the tasks have been completed, the worker process will exit.</p>

<p>The <code>join()</code> method waits for the worker processes to exit. It is required to call <code>close()</code> or <code>terminate()</code> before using <code>join()</code> method.</p>

<p>Both <code>close()</code> and <code>terminate()</code> will stop all the worker processes. The difference is <code>close()</code> will wait for worker process to finish, and <code>terminate()</code> immediately shut down worker processes without completing outstanding work.</p>

<p>Another useful method provided by <code>multiprocessing</code> module is <code>cpu_count()</code>, which returns the number of CPUs in the current system. You can use this value to decide how many processes to create in a pool.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I’m taking a course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/home/welcome">“Algorithm Toolbox”</a> on Coursera. This course provides me a good chance to review and enhance my knowledge in the fundamental algorithms, which usually would help on achieving better system design. This morning I came across one slide of this course and thought it could be very useful. Sharing it here.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://euccas.github.io/images/post_images/2016/20161224-levels-of-design-1.png" width="600" /></p>

<p>It’s important to keep the <strong>levels of (algorithm) design</strong> in mind when solving a problem.</p>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="level-1-naive-algorithm">Level 1: Naive Algorithm</h1>

<p>This is the solution that you can get just by taking the definition of a problem and turning it into an algorithm. This solution can solve the problem, but it is often very slow and inefficient.</p>

<p>The way I see the naive algorithm is it gives you something that works, and might be used to verify if alternative solutions are correct or not. But it’s important to not stay at the this solution. You should keep looking for better solutions.</p>

<h1 id="level-2-algorithm-by-way-of-standard-tools">Level 2: Algorithm by way of standard Tools</h1>

<p>You can look at the standard techniques and see if any of it applies to solving your problem. On this level, your goal is finding some standard techniques that work, often that don’t involve too much effort on your part, and give you something that work very well (better than the naive algorithm).</p>

<h1 id="level-3-optimized-algorithm">Level 3: Optimized Algorithm</h1>

<p>Remember there are always lots of ways to improve an existing solution. If you get a pretty good solution on level 2, why not taking one more step and see what you can do to improve it? Could you reduce the runtime from n-cubed to n-squared or n-squred to n? Could you come up with a shorter solution by rearranging the order or cut out some of the work? Could you use a data structure to speed things up? Think about all these possiblities and see if you can get a even better solution. (Often you will)</p>

<h1 id="level-4-magic-algorithm">Level 4: Magic Algorithm</h1>

<p>When the solutions from the previous three levels are not good enough, you’ll need some magic to get a better one. This can be hard. You will need some clever new ideas and unique insights of the problem you’re trying to solve. Even if you don’t get a magic solution in the end, the thought process will be beneficial.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I finish a project, I do have the feeling that the way I do it is just not good enough, even though the project has been proved to be successful, useful and solved a particular technical challenge we faced. Looking at the “Levels of Design”, I believe what I need to do is spending more efforts on the higher levels. Actually what you really need for getting a really good solution is not magic. What you need is mastering more existing good standard techniques, exploring the possibility for optimization, and a deep understanding of the problem you want to solve.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Generators is a powerful weapon of Python. Generators help you write concise code, give you lazy evaluation, and improve the efficience for calculating large sets of results. Personally I think it’s a good habit to use generators in Python whenever you can, if you really want your code to be Pythonic.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-create-a-generator">How to create a generator</h1>

<p>There are mainly two ways to create a generator: using the <code>yield</code> keyword in the function, or using the <code>()</code> as a generator expression.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>yield</code> keyword makes the function yields control back to the calling function on every iteration</li>
  <li>The <code>()</code> expression returns a generator object</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<h1 id="how-to-refactor-a-function-to-use-a-generator">How to refactor a function to use a generator</h1>

<p>Functions that construct a list or another iterable and returns it can be turned into a generator by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Converting the list append into a <code>yield</code></li>
  <li>Removing the empty list creation</li>
  <li>Removing the return</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="a-generator-example">A generator example</h1>
<p>Let’s see an example: implement a function that takes a list and return a list of the current running mean. For example, given the input list <code>[8, 4, 3, 1, 3, 5]</code>, the expected return result is <code>[8.0, 6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.8, 4.0]</code>.</p>

<p>First we’ll implement it without using generators.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
<span class="line-number">9</span>
<span class="line-number">10</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">running_mean</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="n">average</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="nb">sum</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

</span><span class="line">		<span class="nb">sum</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">num</span>
</span><span class="line">		<span class="n">average</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">sum</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">average</span>
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">running_mean</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Now we can refactor the above implementation to use a generator:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">running_mean</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="nb">sum</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</span><span class="line">	<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">enumerate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class="line">		<span class="nb">sum</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">num</span>
</span><span class="line">		<span class="k">yield</span> <span class="nb">sum</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">running_mean</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>What we did in the refactoring was: replacing the list appending with a yield (<code>average.append()</code>), removing the empty list creation (<code>average = []</code>), and replacing the return statement with a yield statement.</p>

<p>One important property of Python generator object is it is a single-use object. In other words, a generator keeps yielding answers forever. The looping in a generator only ends when the calling function decides to end it. Meanwhile a generator can only be called once.</p>

    <updated>2016-12-17T09:06:21-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://euccas.github.io/blog/20161217/postgresql-understand-pg-errors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When using Ruby Gem <code>pg</code> and establish database connections to a PostgreSQL database, you’ll see PG errors when the database connection becomes problematic. In my experience, two typical PG errors are <code>PG::AdminShutdown</code> and <code>PG::UnableToSend</code>.</p>

<h1 id="error-pgadminshutdown">Error PG::AdminShutdown</h1>

<p>The error message contains the following information:</p>

<p><code>
FATAL:  terminating connection due to administrator command (PG::AdminShutdown) server closed the connection unexpectedly
      This probably means the server terminated abnormally
      before or while processing the request.
</code></p>

<!--more-->

<p>The PG::AdminShutdown error could be caused by database server receiving SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGQUIT or kill command on the connection process. Each system signal shut down server processes in different manners, see the <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/1.4/pg/postmaster-shutdown.html">pgadmin document</a> to know the details.</p>

<p>When you hit the PG::AdminShutdown error, you’ll like to check if the database server gets restarted and if the server resumes to the normal state.</p>

<h1 id="error-pgunabletosend">Error PG::UnabletoSend</h1>

<p>The error message looks like:</p>

<p><code>
server closed the connection unexpectedly (PG::UnableToSend)
This probably means the server terminated abnormally before or while processing the request.
</code></p>

<p>The PG::UnabletoSend error usually means a connection timeout or network issue. It could be a temporary issue though. You can check if the other connections to the database server work well or not.</p>
